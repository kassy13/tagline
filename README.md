Heading
so basically like we all already know that react is a single page application and for that all your components are inside one main component which is your app js , but for us to simulate that we are leaving from this page and entering a new page we use a dependecy cally the react router dom. so what this simply does is that for example if we want to go to about us page it kind of remove the content of the home page and shows us the about page and then adds a path for us to simulate that we have left the home page and have entered the about page

to get started we have to install the
'react-router-dom'
also install tailwindcss
'tailwind-css'
